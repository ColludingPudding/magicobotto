# magicobotto
First attempt at making a discord bot

-------

# Why am I doing this?

This project is mostly for educational purposes, as in creating something so I can ~~skip my real classes cause uni sucks~~. Of course, as long as I'm learning something, I don't feel like it's a waste of time.

# The functions I hope this bot will be able to perform:

I want this bot to have a pollfeed() function
As in, if you give it rights to 2 channels (#submission and #poll), it'll take submissions in #submission, post them in #poll and feed the images that past a certain number of votes to another source as input (I'm thinking of automating a server into an entity and feeding those to twitter and instagram)
Would be very poggu ~~if I don't quit halfway~~

15th Nov 2021 update: I've finished the basic functions and tested out some API calls for the bot. I'm adding the idea to implement openai api into this bot for some amazing functions, but I'm super busy right now so it might be a while til I can work on that. Still, progress has been made!

# Where am I hosting this?

~~Nowhere at this point, cause it's not even working yet ;-;~~

Thanks to the great tutorial Freecodecamp.org uploaded on their youtube channel, I've finished the basics to the bot. The video teaches you both on the basic functions and how to host it on replit. I'd highly suggest watching it for beginners. I've attached the link below
