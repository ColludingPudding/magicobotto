# magicobotto
First attempt at making a discord bot

-------

# Why am I doing this?

This project is mostly for educational purposes, as in creating something so I can ~~skip my real classes cause uni sucks~~. Of course, as long as I'm learning something, I don't feel like it's a waste of time.

# The functions I hope this bot will be able to perform:

I want this bot to have a pollfeed() function
As in, if you give it rights to 2 channels (#submission and #poll), it'll take submissions in #submission, post them in #poll and feed the images that past a certain number of votes to another source as input (I'm thinking of automating a server into an entity and feeding those to twitter and instagram)
Would be very poggu ~~if I don't quit halfway~~

# Where am I hosting this?

Nowhere at this point, cause it's not even working yet ;-;
